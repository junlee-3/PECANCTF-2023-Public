  Greetings </h1>
<p>
112 Earthlings,<br>
101 We have been studying you for some time now.<br>
99 We discovered your Voyager 1 spacecraft<br>
97 When it came in contact with the edges of our galaxy.<br>
110 "Finally, another intelligent lifeform", we thought,<br>
123 Upon finding the golden record within.<br>
71 For too long we thought we were alone in this universe...<br>
114 Of course, initially we could not make sense of it.<br>
101 But, the sounds of your world... they are... beautiful.<br>
101 So many of us wish to visit.<br>
116 In fact, some of us already have...<br>
105 But we are too nervous to make contact.<br>
110 Or at least... we were until now.<br>
103 You see, it has taken a long time for us...<br>
115 To understand your language...<br>
95 And your people.<br>
102 We see the wars waging across your planet<br>
114 And it scares us...<br>
111 Nevertheless, we send this message to you<br>
109 In hope that we can become allies.<br>
95 Two alien races, united...<br>
65 Together, we can change history.<br>
110 Not just for our own planets,<br>
100 But for our entire universe.<br>
114 Maybe we are not alone?<br>
111 Maybe there are others like us?<br>
109 Together, we can continue the search.<br>
101 Together, we can accomplish great things.<br>
100 Please... consider our proposal.<br>
97 We await your reply.<br>
125 We have much to discuss.<br>
</p>
