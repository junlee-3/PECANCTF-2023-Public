  James learnt about Steganography in his cryptography class two weeks ago,
  and he was very interested in trying his new knowledge.
  He decided to add a twist in the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique by not
  using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) to hide a message in an image anymore.

  However, he does not remember now which bit order he used to hide the message
  in the image anymore. You are provided 2 Python scripts which are used to
  extract the hidden message in James's image.

  Can you help him recover his message?

flag:
  - pecan{It_is_not_always_the_Least_Significant_Bit}
value: 190
type: dynamic

  initial: 500
  decay: 4
  function: linear
  minimum: 100
