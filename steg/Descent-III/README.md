# Descent III

## Flag

`pecan{d0wn_4nd_d0wn}`

## Info

I was told someone found something rather unsettling hidden in this image...

### Hint 1

Image colours are made of bits...

### Hint 2

Have you heard of least significant bit?

## Solution

The flag is hidden by 'least significant bit' steganography, which will have to be decoded by
an online tool. 4 bits have been hidden and the flag is revealed as an overlaying image.
