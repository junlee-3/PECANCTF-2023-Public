  When James knew that you were able to recover the hidden message,
  he was so happy and sad at the same time because he knew his method can be
  cracked. He decided to add another twist to his own LSB technique.

  He used two LSB to hide the payload this time, and now he wants to know
  whether you can recover it. One small hint is that he switched between the
  two LSBs based on whether the order of the bit in a byte is even or odd.

  Can you recover his payload this time?
