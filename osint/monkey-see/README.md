To solve this challenge, you should Google to find that Japanese macaques are most famously located in Snow Monkey Park in Japan. 

Then, using Google Maps, you must click on the street view filter to find 360-degree photographs that other Maps users have taken. There are around a dozen in snow monkey park which you must search through to find the suspect wearing the clothing items provided by the challenge. The flag is the location and the date the 360-degree image was submitted to Google, containing the suspect.
