# Lesson Learnt (Part 1)
The first part of the challenge uses book cipher. The clues hidden in the description include the key words;
- books
- cryptology

As well as this, the format of the two notes written by the character Elizabeth are the keys to decipher successfully.

Tools like these could be used to solve the challenge:
- Boxentriq: https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/book-cipher
- or perhaps manually through logical pattern recognition
