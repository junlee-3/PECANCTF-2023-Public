# Lesson Learnt (Part 2)
You need the answer to Part 1 of this challenge to solve this. 

The answer in the previous part was the three words "taming", "halves" and "simple". This challenge uses the what3words geocode system to locate Elizabeth. The context clues hidden in the description to decrypt using this code system include the key words:
   - location
   - code

Once the student has found the coordinate location of Elizabeth, the closest named place on the map is "Plumridge Lakes" which is the flag. 

This can be solved using;
   - what3words.com

Additionally, if students search "3 words code" in Google this website will be the first option.
